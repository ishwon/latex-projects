        We're going to learn how to write simple {\LaTeX} code in this session after going through a brief history of the program. We will use an editor called Texmaker and {\tt texlive} packages installed on a Linux distribution. Some users might feel at ease witing {\em code} in their preferred editor; for this purpose we will use Visual Studio Code.\\

        I would recommend using openSUSE Tumbleweed but attendees are free to spin up their own favorite distro for this session.
